# First ML Project  
This is my first Machine Learning project using Python.  
I built a simple Linear Regression model to predict exam scores based on study hours.  

## Steps I learned:
- Setting up Git & GitHub  
- Creating a Conda environment  
- Installing ML libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)  
- Building and running a Linear Regression model  

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run `python first_ml.py`
